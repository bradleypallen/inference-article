# Inference Corporation &mdash; 1978 to 2000

## Early years
Inference was originally started as Cognitive Systems Corporation by Alexander Jacobson of Hughes Research and Chuck Williams of USC ISI, who teamed up to attempt to tackle the problem of building a usable natural language user interface to relational databases.

### Origins at USC ISI and Hughes Research
Chuck Williams was a young researcher at USC ISI. Alex Jacobson was a senior executive at Hughes Research, with roots in the Caltech community.

### Work on natural language understanding at CDC
Jacobson and Williams obtained a contract from CDC to prototype a natural language interface. Work on this project created much of the incentive and many of the technical ideas around expert systems reasoning and knowledge representation embodied in Inference's products.

### Involvement with Wolfram and the development of SMP
As an additional business line, to provide a source of revenue to support the  project, Jacobson worked with Steven Wolfram of Caltech to build and productize a computer algebra system created by Wolfram, called SMP. The relationship was difficult to manage, and SMP would eventually lead Wolfram to establish his own company Mathematica, which carries forward many of the ideas initially build into SMP. The time spent on building a team to support SMP brought many talented technologists to Inference.

### The early development of the expert systems shell
The work on building a natural language understanding system yielded a great deal of effort in building tools. Eventually the focus shifted to building the tools themselves as a initial step to get software products to market. An initial version of this tool where called Axiom, but it would be renamed to the Automated Reasoning Tool (ART).

### Involvement with the founding of Lisp Machines Incorporated
The tools were built on top of Lisp, and the emergence of specialized hardware and workstation environments for Lisp application development was seen as a way to dramatically improve developer productivity. Jacobson and Williams got involved with the MIT-based efforts in building Lisp machines, and were directly involved in the founding of Lisp Machines Incorporated (LMI), one of the two startups out of MIT to deliver Lisp machines to the market.

## The "Gang of Four" and the dawn of the expert systems market
Motivated by governmental and defense initiatives in the industrialization of artificial intelligence, interest in the venture capital community in the creation of startups to deliver products in support of those initiatives, and the glamor associated with the "thinking machine" trope, a number of expert systems companies formed around the period from 1982 to 1985. Inference was one of the initial "Gang of Four" venture-funded expert systems startups, and the only one not directly associated with Stanford University and based in the Bay Area.

### Venture funding by Venrock
Alex Jacobson managed to close an investment round with Venrock, with Tony Sun of Venrock taking a seat on the board. This was the initial capital infusion that allowed Inference to begin to build the team that would deliver ART to market.
